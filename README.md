#Simple Edit Distance

In computational linguistics and computer science, edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings
(e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into
the other. Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can
determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance
to the word in question. In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can
be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T.

Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.

#Levenstein Distance

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences
in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from the longest common substring problem: unlike
substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest
common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the
diff utility, and has applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics. It is also widely used by revision
control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.
